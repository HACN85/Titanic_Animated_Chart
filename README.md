Hello everyone !
Today I'm going to share something I learned and built using hashtag#ipyvizzu library - Press Play â–¶ 

This hashtag#python code showcases ðŸš¢Titanic passenger data through an animated chart! Click a button to refresh and explore details: gender distribution and survival rates post-disaster.
ðŸš¨ Why opt for animation? Animated charts are potent in presentations or meetings, engaging audiences through visual data hashtag#storytelling . They unveil temporal changes, clarify trends, and offer contextual insights, particularly in historical contexts like the Titanic disaster.
âš¡ Advantages? Enhanced understanding of temporal shifts, detailed data evolution visualization, and heightened audience engagement. They focus on specific data changes dynamically, presenting information in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

ðŸ“š Libraries Used:
hashtag#streamlit : Simplifies web app creation using Python scripts, enabling an interactive interface.
hashtag#pandas : Facilitates data manipulation and analysis in Python.
hashtag#ipyvizzu: Generates interactive visualizations, like the animated Titanic chart.

hashtag#html & hashtag#javascript : Embedded into Streamlit for added functionality, such as page refresh and interactive elements.
Source: hashtag#kaggle Dataset > Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

In essence, animated charts are robust tools for illustrating evolving data trends and boosting audience engagement.
